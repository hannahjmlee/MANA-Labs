# Multi-Agent Navigation Algorithms Labs

This is Hannah's Multi-Agent Navigation Algorithm (MANA) Labs library. This is a Python library with code developed for experimental algorithm development. For my testing library in C++, please see MANA-Core. For my development library in python, please see MANA-Labs. To start,
begin by running:
```
chmod +x init.sh
./init.sh
```
This will load all of the map and scenario files necessary for running
experiments. Please look at examples on how to run MAPF scenarios in main.py. For a more comprehensive review of how to run scenarios, look at the 'tests' directory. 

## Multi-Agent Pathfinding Algorithms
Currently, we support the following multi-agent pathfinding algorithms:
- Conflict-Based Search (CBS)
- Improved Conflict-Based Search (ICBS)
- Pathfinding with Rapid Information Sharing using Motion constraints (PRISM)

We will be adding these algorithms in future releases:
- Priority-Based Search (PBS)
- Hierarchical Composition Conflict-Based Search (HC-CBS)
